# An example project to use GWT 2.8 and new add-on archetypes

I did a much [improved add-on archetypes](https://github.com/viritin/archetype-vaadin-gwt-addon) a while ago. Also 7.7 now allows one to use GWT 2.8. This example shows how to use them together.

Also see [Jonni's blog post](https://vaadin.com/blog/-/blogs/how-to-use-gwt-2-8-in-vaadin-applications-today) that explains what to do in your project if you wish to convert it to using GWT 2.8.
